# EDA-Capstone-project
Project Overview:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in any data science or analytics project. It involves examining datasets to summarize their main characteristics, detect patterns, spot anomalies, and test hypotheses using visual and statistical techniques. This EDA capstone project aims to analyze a supply chain dataset (SCMS Delivery History) to extract meaningful insights, identify trends, and provide data-driven recommendations for business improvement.
